<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are already some php frameworks that are very handy to make web developement easier, however none of them is as leightweight and fast as LUNA. It's small size make it possible to use it in very small projects, while still having the option to expand it's capabilities and use it in large projects.

Also LUNA can be used with frontend frameworks like React, etc. where the frontend framework is the "view" component of the Model-View-Controller pattern.

Someone might say that you should use php for your next project, but a lot of developer forget how powerfull php is. Remember that php is exclusively made for web applications and still a fast and widely used language. 

Why should I use this framework?
* To create fast and leightweight web applications with a modern structure
* To profit from the MVC pattern in small projects without the need of starting from scratch 
* To expand it capabilities and use it in a much bigger scale

Be aware that LUNA is under active developement and can/will change a lot in the future. What is currently missing is that you should be able to remove unused "modules" to improve performance even further and minimize the size. This will be done by making those modules indepentend from each other.

A list of resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [PHP](https://www.php.net/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It is very easy to use LUNA. Just follow the installation introductions and you are ready to go. However you need to understand the MVC-Pattern to use the framework.

### Prerequisites

First of all you need just a basic web dev envoirement. I can recommend to use vs code but you can use any editor. You can also use your prefered server, but if you want to keep it simple you can just use XAMPP or Laragon. I can recommend Laragon, it is much easier to setup and use. 

### Installation

1. Create a dir for your project
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SmartMointy/small-mvc-framework
```
3. Set the root directory of the webserver to the src/public_html/ folder
4. Change the database settings in the src/app/configs/database.ini.php to match your local database settings
5. Done!
